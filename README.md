# TypeScript Superpowers: Meet Interfaces, Types, and the Magic of Inference

Want to bring structure, safety, and scalability to your JavaScript projects? Then, unlike many developers, meet your new friend TypeScript. It will make your JavaScript code safer and easier to manage. But how? The obvious answer is TypeScript will do the magic by letting you define the types of your variables, objects, and functions. 

If you’re just starting out, learning about interfaces, types, their differences, and how TypeScript guesses types (type inference) will help you write cleaner and more reliable code.

## Interfaces: Describing Object Shapes

An **interface** is a contract for the shape of an object or class. You can also call it a blueprint. It says what properties the object must have.

```ts
interface Mentor {
  name: string;
}
interface Mentor {
  age: number;
}

const mentor: Mentor = { name: "Persian Vai", age: 28 }; // This works!
```

In TypeScript, you can declare interfaces more than once, and TypeScript will merge them together. That’s why the `Mentor` interface above includes both `name` and `age`.

### Extending Interfaces

You can also make a new interface based on an existing one.

```ts
interface Student extends Mentor {
  studentId: string;
}

const student: Student = {
  name: "Shamim",
  age: 25,
  studentId: "L2B5-0155",
};
```

## Type Aliases: Flexible and Powerful

A **type** is another way to describe data, but it’s more flexible than an interface. You can use it for objects, combinations of types, and even simple values.

```ts
// Type representing a subject mark
type Marks = {
  math: number;
  science: number;
};

// Union type (|): A Pet can be a Dog or a Cat
type Pet = { kind: "dog"; bark: () => void } | { kind: "cat"; meow: () => void };

// Intersection type (&): Both a singer and a dancer
type Singer = { sing: () => void };
type Dancer = { dance: () => void };
type Performer = Singer & Dancer;

// Using the types
const studentMarks: Marks = {
  math: 95,
  science: 88,
};

const myPet: Pet = {
  kind: "Cat",
  meow: () => console.log("Meow Meow!"),
};

const stagePerformer: Performer = {
  sing: () => console.log("Singing a song!"),
  dance: () => console.log("Dancing on stage!"),
};
```

## Interfaces vs Types: What’s the Difference?

| Feature             | Interface               | Type Alias                    |
|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Can be merged?      | ✅ Yes                  | ❌ No                         |
| Can extend others?  | ✅ Yes (with `extends`) | ✅ Yes (with `&` intersection)|
| Can use unions?     | ❌ No                   | ✅ Yes                       |
| Best for           | Object shapes           | Unions, primitives, combinations |

## When to Use Each?

**Use interface when:**

- Describing the shape of objects or classes.
- You want to take advantage of declaration merging.

**Use type when:**

- You’re combining different types (like strings and numbers).
- You’re working with union (`|`) or intersection (`&`) types.

> **Next Level Tip:** Many developers use interfaces for object structures, and types for everything else.

## Type Inference: TypeScript Figures It Out

You don’t always have to tell TypeScript what type a variable is - it can guess based on how you use it. This is called **type inference**. And it's one of TypeScript’s most powerful features.

```ts
let message = "Hello!";      // inferred as string
let count = 5;               // inferred as number
let isLoggedIn = true;       // inferred as boolean
```

#### Functions

```ts
function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b; // TypeScript knows this returns a number
}
```

#### Arrays

```ts
let mixed = [1, "hello", true]; // inferred as (number | string | boolean)[]
```

## When Should You Add Types?

Yes, TypeScript can guess, but sometimes it's better to write the type yourself:

- When writing function parameters and return types
- For complex objects
- To make your code easier to read for others

```ts
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
}

interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const user: User = { name: "Shamim", age: 25 };
```

## Conclusion: Mastering TypeScript’s Type System

- Use **interface** to describe the shape of objects, especially if you need to extend or merge them.
- Use **type** for combining multiple types, defining unions, or creating custom names for primitives.
- Rely on **type inference** to reduce repetitive code — it makes your code shorter but still safe!
- Keep practicing — it gets easier and more fun as you go!
